You can use this folder to create custom cups.
Currently, custom cups are extremely buggy and they only work properly in Grand Prix.
It is possible to use custom cups in Time Trials, but keep in mind the game may crash when switching tracks inside custom cups, so make sure to load an normal track between each custom cup track.
Custom cups currently don't work in VS Mode, this will be fixed in a future update.
